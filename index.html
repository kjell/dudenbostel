    <p>These images and their accompanying narrative were posted on the internet for a while. They were all created by Lynn Dudenbostel, the luthier in many of the photos. Here he happens to be building a batch of two mandolins, one for Chris Thile and one for a fellow named Gary Hedricks.</p>

    <p>I wish that I could build mandolins. I want to try it, and have been looking for good info on the web that might help me dive in. Although there are a few images missing, this is one of the best resources I've found.</p>

    <p>These same images used to be posted on another site, but they disappeared. I dug them up (unfortunately a few of the images were missing, but most survived) and made the html pages look a bit cleaner, then checked with Lynn to see if he'd be ok with me reposting them. He was, voil√†.</p>
