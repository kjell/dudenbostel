<TD>37) Now I have a reference for placing the tone bars.  I take my measurements from the upper and lower points of the F holes.  I'm marking the location of the treble bar here.</TR>

<TD>38) Fitting the tone bars can be quite time consuming.  I take 1/4" wide spruce, position it over the line I've marked inside the top, and use a compass to transfer the outline of the top to the tone bar.  I then take it to the bandsaw and cut off the excess.</TR>

<TD>39) Using a fingerplace, scraper, Exacto, and sandpaper, I fit the bar to the top.  This often take a couple of hours.  Not only is the
  contour changing along the length, but it the angle of intersection with the top changes as well.  It has to be a perfect fit.</TR>

<TD>40) Once the tone bars are fitted to my satisfaction, I put a coat of hot hide glue on the mating surfaces and let it dry.  This glue penetrates into the wood, and when more glue is added later, results in a very strong bond.</TR>
<TR><TD> <a href="dude41.jpg"> <IMG src="dude41_small.jpg" alt="dude8.jpg " border="2" width="100" height="75" ></a></TD>
<TD>41) I've masked the location of the one bars on the top with tape and am applying the glue to the top also.</TR>
<TR><TD> <a href="dude42.jpg"> <IMG src="dude42_small.jpg" alt="dude8.jpg " border="2" width="100" height="75" ></a></TD>
<TD>42) After the "pre-gluing" step has had time to dry, I apply more hot hide glue to the tone bar and the top and place it in position.  I apply clamps to each end, then cam clamps along it's length.  One nice thing about hot hide glue is it is that dried "re-activated" by the application of fresh glue.  Hide glue is the adhesive used on postage stamps and envelopes.  Your own body heat and moisture from your tongue are enough to "re-activate" the glue.</TR>
<TR><TD> <a href="dude43.jpg"> <IMG src="dude43_small.jpg" alt="dude8.jpg " border="2" width="100" height="75" ></a></TD>
<TD>43) As you can see in this picture, the tone bars are glued on without shaping first.</TR>
<TR><TD> <a href="dude44.jpg"> <IMG src="dude44_small.jpg" alt="dude8.jpg " border="2" width="100" height="75" ></a></TD>
<TD>44) Now I'm applying the gauze reinforcements to the inside of the F holes.  A piece of guaze is cut slightly larger than the F hole and hot hide glue is brushed on.  The gauze will be cut out from the F holes later after the glue is dry.  I guess you could leave it on to keep the flies out!.</TR>
<TR><TD> <a href="dude45.jpg"> <IMG src="dude45_small.jpg" alt="dude8.jpg " border="2" width="100" height="75" ></a></TD>
<TD>45) The tone bars are fairly small. Only 0.250 to about 0.300 inches high at the center. They really aren't structural members. I use a fingerplane and chisels to shape them to a kind of rounded triangle cross-section. They taper out to nothing just short of intersecting the headblock and kerfed lining on the other end. As they taper out, they get progressivly flatter. </TR>
