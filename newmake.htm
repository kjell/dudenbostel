<H2>In 2001 a mandolin was built for Chris Thile and one for Gary Hedricks .  The building process was documented and  the pictures and comments made available via the now defunct PhotoPoint web site.  The quality and quantity of these pictures made them a superb resource for makers.<BR>
Now that the original resource is off line I have put them together into this collection.<BR>
I have split the files up into small groups of about 10 pictures on a page.</H2><p>All
