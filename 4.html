  <p class="overview">Tone Bars.</p>
  <dl>
      <dt id="37"><img src="dude37.jpg"></dt><dd>37) Now I have a reference for placing the tone bars.  I take my measurements from the upper and lower points of the F holes.  I'm marking the location of the treble bar here.</dd>
      <dt id="38"><img src="dude38.jpg"></dt><dd>38) Fitting the tone bars can be quite time consuming.  I take 1/4" wide spruce, position it over the line I've marked inside the top, and use a compass to transfer the outline of the top to the tone bar.  I then take it to the bandsaw and cut off the excess.</dd>
      <dt id="39"><img src="dude39.jpg"></dt><dd>39) Using a fingerplace, scraper, Exacto, and sandpaper, I fit the bar to the top.  This often take a couple of hours.  Not only is the
  contour changing along the length, but it the angle of intersection with the top changes as well.  It has to be a perfect fit.</dd>
      <dt id="40"><img src="dude40.jpg"></dt><dd>40) Once the tone bars are fitted to my satisfaction, I put a coat of hot hide glue on the mating surfaces and let it dry.  This glue penetrates into the wood, and when more glue is added later, results in a very strong bond.</dd>
      <dt id="41"><img src="dude41.jpg"></dt><dd>41) I've masked the location of the one bars on the top with tape and am applying the glue to the top also.</dd>
      <dt id="42"><img src="dude42.jpg"></dt><dd>42) After the "pre-gluing" step has had time to dry, I apply more hot hide glue to the tone bar and the top and place it in position.  I apply clamps to each end, then cam clamps along it's length.  One nice thing about hot hide glue is it is that dried "re-activated" by the application of fresh glue.  Hide glue is the adhesive used on postage stamps and envelopes.  Your own body heat and moisture from your tongue are enough to "re-activate" the glue.</dd>
      <dt id="43"><img src="dude43.jpg"></dt><dd>43) As you can see in this picture, the tone bars are glued on without shaping first.</dd>
      <dt id="44"><img src="dude44.jpg"></dt><dd>44) Now I'm applying the gauze reinforcements to the inside of the F holes.  A piece of guaze is cut slightly larger than the F hole and hot hide glue is brushed on.  The gauze will be cut out from the F holes later after the glue is dry.  I guess you could leave it on to keep the flies out!.</dd>
      <dt id="45"><img src="dude45.jpg"></dt><dd>45) The tone bars are fairly small. Only 0.250 to about 0.300 inches high at the center. They really aren't structural members. I use a fingerplane and chisels to shape them to a kind of rounded triangle cross-section. They taper out to nothing just short of intersecting the headblock and kerfed lining on the other end. As they taper out, they get progressivly flatter. </dd>
