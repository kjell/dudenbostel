  <p class="overview">Plate thicknessing, F hole cutting.</p>
  <dl>
      <dt id="29"><img src="dude29.jpg"></dt><dd>29) The form is flipped over and the label is applied.  I use my plexiglas template to figure out approximately where the F holes are so I can center the label.</dd>
      <dt id="30"><img src="dude30.jpg"></dt><dd>30) I started carving a perfect piece of red spruce for Gary's mandolin and after the final cut, noticed a small cosmetic blemish.  As a result, I won't use this top.  Acoustically and structurally, it's fine.  Anyone want a good deal on a mandolin top?!</dd>
      <dt id="31"><img src="dude31.jpg"></dt><dd>31) Back to Chris' mandolin now.  The Englemann spruce is on my duplicator.  Here it is after the first pass.</dd>
      <dt id="32"><img src="dude32.jpg"></dt><dd>32) I set the router for a slightly deeper cut and make a second pass." </dd>
      <dt id="32b"><img src="dude32b.jpg"></dt><dd>32b) The third pass pretty much does it.</dd>
      <dt id="33"><img src="dude33.jpg"></dt><dd>33) Now, I start checking thicknesses and planning (with finger planes, to near the final thickness.  I'm using my calipers to check progress.</dd>
      <dt id="34"><img src="dude34.jpg"></dt><dd>34) I tap the tops to see what note they resonate at.  There is no good historical data on just what note it should be, so I keep a record of what each one taps at and figure out what works best for me.  I'll check it again once the f holes are cut and the tone bars are carved.</dd>
      <dt id="35"><img src="dude35.jpg"></dt><dd>35) The top is graduated on Chris' mandolin and I'm ready to route the F holes.  I use a small radial arm saw (that has a router bit collet) and set it up as a pin router.  I'm pointing to an 1/8" diameter pin in the base, and there is an 1/8" dia. bit in the collet.  I've taken a
  plexiglas template with the F holes cut in it, and using double stick tape, attach it to the inside of the top.</dd>
      <dt id="36"><img src="dude36.jpg"></dt><dd>36) I flip the entire thing over, put the F hole cutout over the pin, and slowly lower the router bit until it makes contact at the highest point.  It takes about 6 passes to route the F hole, going just a bit deeper with each pass.  Doing it this way assure proper size and location of the F holes every time.</dd>
